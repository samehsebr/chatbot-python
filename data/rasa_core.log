/home/sameh/.local/lib/python2.7/site-packages/pykwalify/core.py:99: UnsafeLoaderWarning: 
The default 'Loader' for 'load(stream)' without further arguments can be unsafe.
Use 'load(stream, Loader=ruamel.yaml.Loader)' explicitly if that is OK.
Alternatively include the following in your code:

  import warnings
  warnings.simplefilter('ignore', ruamel.yaml.error.UnsafeLoaderWarning)

In most other cases you should consider using 'safe_load(stream)'
  data = yaml.load(stream)
